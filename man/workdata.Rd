\description{
A simulated dataset of individuals' working trajectories during late working life and retirement
age. The state space consists of three transient states (working; retired; not working)
and one absorbing state (dead). The age range covers ages 50 to 99. The data is
simulated using transition probabilities published as part of Dudel & Myrskyl√§ (2017).
